# Getting Started

SpatialXomics is a web-based platform for managing, analyzing, and visualizing mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) data.

**Author:** Chen Kejiang

**Feedback:** Found a bug or have a suggestion? Open a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/NeoNexusX/MassVision/issues) or email **jydong@xmu.edu.cn**.



## Overview

MSI data files are large and often scattered across instruments and personal machines. Researchers typically juggle local environments, multiple tools, and manual workflows—making data sharing, reproducibility, and visualization difficult.

SpatialXomics brings the most common MSI data management and analysis tasks into a single web platform. Upload imzML/ibd pairs from your browser, fill in metadata, then manage, preprocess, visualize, and analyze your datasets—all without installing anything locally.

**Who is this for?**

- MSI, metabolomics, and mass spectrometry researchers who need a central place to manage, share, and download imzML datasets.
- Anyone who wants to run denoising, baseline correction, intensity normalization, peak picking, or peak alignment in the cloud.
- Users who need ion images, mean spectra, annotation matching, or UMAP/KMeans tissue segmentation.



## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---|---|
| **Accounts & Permissions** | Registration, login, password recovery, profile editing. Admins can manage all users. |
| **Data Upload** | Upload paired .imzML/.ibd files with automatic deduplication, ZIP compression, chunked upload, and resume. |
| **Dataset Management** | Browse public datasets, manage your own, inspect metadata, share public pages, and download originals. |
| **Preprocessing** | Compatible methods shown automatically based on your data's spectrum/storage mode: noise reduction, baseline correction, normalization, peak picking, peak alignment. |
| **Visualization** | Continuous mode: ion images + mean spectra. Processed mode: TIC images + per-pixel spectra. Adjustable range, gamma, colormap, TIC normalization, and transparent PNG export. |
| **Spatial Analysis** | UMAP/KMeans clustering, cluster filtering, rectangular/freeform ROIs, and multi-region comparison. |
| **Annotation Matching** | Import CSV annotation tables, match by m/z with ppm or Da tolerance, filter, export, and query PubChem. |



## Quick Start

### 1. Open the Platform

Click **Join to start** on the landing page.

### 6. Upload Your Own Data

Click **Upload New Dataset** to add a private dataset.

![Upload button](https://official-oss.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/20260908135743254.jpg_view)

Select your .imzML and .ibd files (they must share the same base filename), then fill in the required metadata (see [Upload Data](./upload-data)). Fields marked with \* are mandatory.

![Upload form](https://official-oss.oss-cn-hongkong.aliyuncs.com/docs/20260908140402663.jpg_view)

Once uploaded, your dataset appears under **Datahub > My Datasets**.

### 7. Run an Analysis

Go to **Workspace > New Analysis**, pick a dataset, and choose preprocessing steps (see [Dataset Analysis](./dataset-analysis)).

**Example:** Select "Mouse_Kidney_MALDI_30_Negative_77bf5d" and enable denoising, baseline correction, normalization, peak picking, and peak alignment.
